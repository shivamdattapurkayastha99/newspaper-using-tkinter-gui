Assembly Session Crucial Now For Ashok Gehlot, He Clashes With Governor | Live Updates
The manner in which you protested at Raj Bhavan &t he kind of slogans which were raised, I think no other CM can do something as condemnable as this. Nation & legal experts should look into this that CM is saying that people will do 'gherao' of Raj Bhawan. I urge the central govt to not leave the law and order in the hands of Rajasthan Police and deploy CRPF here so that the sanctity of this constitutional post is upheld. Those protesting at Raj Bhawan should be driven out & all legal remedies should be used for it

I am sure that governor will not come under any pressure. We hope the Assembly session begins soon. So we are sitting here in protest. After he gives us a letter we will decide the further course of action: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot

Governor is our constitutional head. I don't hesitate to say that he couldn't have stopped it (Assembly Session) without some pressure from the top. Why did he not decide yesterday? We've requested him again to make a decision soon. People are waiting: Gehlot
